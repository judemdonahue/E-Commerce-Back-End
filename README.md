## Description
This e-commerce back end was started with an existing Express.js API and integrated Sequelize to facilitate seamless interactions with a MySQL database, enabling efficient data management.

This project, aimed to solve the problem of providing a robust and scalable back end infrastructure for the e-commerce site. The integration of Sequelize and MySQL allowed for efficient handling of product listings, inventory management, user authentication, and order processing, ultimately enhancing the overall shopping experience.

The development process provided valuable insights into working with Express.js, configuring Sequelize for database interactions, and handling complex e-commerce workflows. We learned about optimizing database queries, implementing secure user authentication mechanisms, and designing scalable back end architectures to support the growing demands of an e-commerce platform. This project provided us with practical experience in building reliable and efficient back ends for e-commerce applications.
